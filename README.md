# R Day at Volta

R is a programming language for data analysis, visualization, and communication. The goal of this workshop is to provide an opportunity for developers to get a feel for the R language and to get started analyzing their own data in R. 

Topics Covered

- R Basics: “Why can’t I just do this in Python?”

- dplyr: Fast, flexible data manipulation

- ggplot2: A grammar of graphics

- shiny: Responsive web applications in R

# Requirements

Each participant should bring their own laptop, ideally with R and RStudio already installed.

R is freely available here: http://mirror.its.dal.ca/cran/

RStudio is a free IDE for R, I would recommend the preview version: http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/

Participants are asked to bring a dataset that they were interested in working with. This could be something related to work, or any other subject matter. There will be datasets available in the workshop, but it is usually more meaningful if they are working with their own materials.
